## TOPdesk Reader (Read an old TOPdesk database)
This project is created since our company has a old TOPdesk instance that we need to be able to read.<br>
This lets you read Tickets, Changes and ChangeActivites at the moment.<br>
<br>
You need to configure the database in the .env file, look at .env example.<br>
These lines needs to be configured (you need a On-Prem MSSQL database for TOPdesk for this to work)<br>
<br>
``
MSSQL_SERVER=""
MSSQL_DATABASE=""<br>
MSSQL_USERNAME=""<br>
MSSQL_PASSWORD=""<br>`
``
<br>
<br>
If you have any questions feel free to ask for assistance.
